# Twilio-Translation
This application was a group project developed for MLH (Major League Hacking) Local Hack Day October 12 2019. It is a project implementing Twilio written in Javascript. We ran our javascript code through the online tool Glitch.

The project allows users to text a number with a language code and a sentence to have it translated. The format for using this program is as such.

[LanguageCode] "String"
  
Language Code follows [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes).

Note: Since we are using Twilio Free Trial, only authorized numbers can use this service
